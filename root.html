    <h1>Uniting the Nation with his Swingline Stapler</h1>
    Stephen Root’s IMDb profile lists over 200 credits in both films and TV shows, doing both on-camera roles and voice
    work for animated series. That includes everything from historical dramas to children’s fare; from prestige TV to
    raunchy comedies. In other words, he’s the consummate character actor, willing to throw himself into the hands of
    whatever project tickles his peculiar fancy. With the recent premiere of his latest film role, in the Jason
    Schwartzman-starring 7 Chinese Brothers, we decided to offer up our picks for Root’s best comedic performances.

    <p>
        Great as he was in NewsRadio, the world will long remember Root for his performance as Milton, the
        mealy-mouthed, long-suffering drone at IniTech who wants nothing more but to keep his sweaty hands on the
        coveted red Swingline stapler. For as great as his vocal work is, Root’s physical comedy here is priceless, as
        he shuffles and twitches and jerks his head around like a nervous squirrel.
