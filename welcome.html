        <h1 class="cover-heading">So, a little about me...</h1>
        <p class="lead">I've been around the world and I, I, I, I've been player hated. I started from the bottom,
            now I'm here. But look at me now...I'm gettin' paper! And I am whatever you say I am. If I wasn't then why would I say I am? In the papers, the news, every day I am.
            I don't know, it's just the way I am.
        <p class="lead">
            I wanna be the very best,
            like no one ever was.
            To catch them is my real test,
            to train them is my cause.
            I will travel across the land
            searching far and wide.
            Teach Pok√©mon to understand
            the power that's inside.</p>
        <p class="lead">
            I can show you the world.
            Shining, shimmering, splendid.
            Tell me, princess, now when did
            you last let your heart decide?
            I can open your eyes.
            Take you wonder by wonder.
            Over, sideways and under
            on a magic carpet ride.
            A whole new world.
            A new fantastic point of view.
            No one to tell us no or where to go
            or say we're only dreaming.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            I wish I was a little bit taller.
            I wish I was a baller.
            I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her.
            I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
            and a six four Impala.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            Am I, your fire?
            Your one desire.
            Yes I know it's too late,
            but I want it that way.
            Tell me why,
            ain't nothin' but a heartache.
            Tell me why,
            ain't nothin' but a mistake.
            Tell me why,
            I never want to hear you say
            I want it that way.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            I took her out, it was a Friday night.
            I wore cologne to get the feeling right.
            We started making out and she took off my pants
            but then I turned on the TV.
            And that's about the time she walked away from me.
            Nobody likes you when you're twenty three.
            And I'm still more amused by TV shows.
            What the hell is A.D.D.?
            My friends say I should act my age.
            What's my age again?
            What's my age again?
